# SEED Labs — Network Security Exercises

SEED Labs network security exercises covering encryption, traffic analysis,
and ARP-based man-in-the-middle attacks, conducted in isolated virtual
environments for educational purposes.

This repository contains a collection of network security labs completed
using the SEED Labs framework as part of academic coursework.

## Topics Covered

- Encryption and secure communication
- Packet inspection and traffic analysis
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack mechanics
- ARP cache poisoning and ICMP behavior

## Environment & Ethics

All experiments were conducted strictly in isolated virtual environments
using Docker containers and private IP ranges.  
No real networks were targeted, and no unauthorized systems were accessed.
