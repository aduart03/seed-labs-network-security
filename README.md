# SEED Labs — Network Security Exercises
SEED Labs network security exercises covering encryption, traffic analysis, and ARP-based man-in-the-middle attacks, conducted in isolated virtual environments for educational purposes.

This repository contains a collection of network security labs completed
using the SEED Labs framework as part of academic coursework.

The labs explore foundational security concepts including:

- Encryption and secure communication
- Packet inspection and traffic analysis
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack mechanics
- ARP cache poisoning and ICMP behavior

All experiments were conducted in isolated virtual environments using
Docker containers and private IP ranges for educational purposes only.
